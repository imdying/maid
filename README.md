 A [command-line interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command-line_interpreter) designed for simplicity and ease-of-use.
 
 In a nutshell, Maid is just an abstraction of [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api). It simplifies the process of defining and managing commands, making it easier for developers to focus on their commands.

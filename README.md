A [command-line interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command-line_interpreter) designed for simplicity and ease-of-use.

In a nutshell, Maid serves as an abstraction layer for [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api), streamlining the process of defining and managing commands.
